## Projects
### Data Analytics
## Project 1: [Analysis of forecasting competition aggregation method performance](https://github.com/MisokralPanovic/Forecasting-Competition-Data-Analysis)
This report investigates the performance of different aggregation methods for forecasting competition assessment, using the RCT-A dataset from the HFC competition. I evaluated the five aggregation methods and proposed an improvement based on the best-performing method.

The dataset was analysed using the data.table R package, which allows fast and memory efficient handling of data.

**Skills:** R data.tables, RMarkdown
